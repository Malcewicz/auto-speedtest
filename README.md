# auto-speedtest

Auto speedtest is a simple python script that will automatically run a chosen amount of speedtests with a time between the tests selected by the user

Once all tests are finished the program will write the results to a csv file called speedtestResults.csv like shown below:

# How to run the script

To run the script I use the windows command line and python. In CMD go to the folder in which the script is located and type:
`python auto-speedtest.py`
Thats it, now the script will start and create a speedtestResults.csv file in the same location.
